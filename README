Near duplicate folder names are because I included usernames in base64 both with and without \n.  In the index.html page, we had to use base64(guest\n) because is came out with a base64 strings that didn't need any padding characters (ie ==).  If we would have used it without the \n (Z3Vlc3Q=) and truncated the =, then the decode would have come up with a very confusing "guec3Q" instead of "guest\n".  Most students and instructors doing this exercise don't realize that guest has a line return and become confused when they try to generate the other folder names, so I created folders with and without the line return to keep it a less complex.
